# Stochastic Optimization Project

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of various stochastic optimization algorithms. These algorithms were tested initially on a well-known test function and then applied to a more complex function to find minima.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **Sampling Techniques**
   - Gibbs Sampler
   - Simplified Gibbs Sampler

2. **Gradient Descent**

3. **Genetic Algorithm**

4. **Simulated Annealing**

5. **Heuristic Algorithm**

## Test Functions

### 1. Cross-in-Tray Function

The Cross-in-Tray function was used as a test function to evaluate the performance of the implemented algorithms. It provided a challenging yet accessible landscape for optimization tasks.

### 2. Energy Balance Function

A more complex function, the Energy Balance function, was used to further evaluate the algorithms. This function represents an energy balance with specific characteristics, making it a suitable candidate for testing the algorithms' capabilities in handling complex optimization scenarios.

## Evaluation Results

The algorithms were tested and evaluated using both test functions. Results were analyzed to assess each algorithm's effectiveness in finding minima and navigating complex solution spaces.
